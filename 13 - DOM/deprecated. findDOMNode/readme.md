# findDOMNode

## Will be deprecated in the future

[findDOMNode](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#finddomnode) still has some valid use cases, like accessing a DOM node outside of the component or React tree. However, it blocks future improvements in React, so [findDOMNode will eventually be deprecated](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/issues/678).
